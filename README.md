# Haskell Practice
A compilation of programs and notes I've written over the years while learning Haskell.

Had these all buried in a folder, but wanted to store them somewhere, in case I can use them later... and finally learn enough Haskell to use for practical problems.

Most of this code isn't any good.. yet. But that's part of learning.
